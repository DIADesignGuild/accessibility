#Open Call for an Accessibility Apprentice

Hello! I am the accessibility lead here at DIA, as well as a mentor. I am the one who’s been working on the Axe-Con watch party for next week, as well as working on a number of other accessibility components behind the scenes.

I am looking for someone who is interested in accessibility and/or inclusive design to help with our accessibility initiatives. 

##What am I working on?

- Building and running an empathy lab workshop series for the summer. An empathy lab is basically a way to help folks see how design choices affect different groups of people with disabilities. So we’ll be looking at how someone uses a screen reader, voice accessibility, or color blindness, just to name a few. People with disabilities have very different types of online experiences, and when designing, it’s essential to take that into consideration. We’ll look at how to do that as well.
- Accessible documentation via the UX Codex, and on github. It’s my goal to be able to send every apprentice out into the world with a checklist or toolkit of inclusive design and accessibility considerations when looking at any design project. It’s essentially a heuristic evaluation. That’s something that I need help working on.
 
I also have an accessibility resource library I’ve been working on that needs to be moved over to the UX Codex and updated.
- Helping me set up the structure for live accessibility auditing events for apprentices and walking through how to do accessibility annotation. This structure will be used as a part of the documentation process as well.

##What’s the time commitment?

Two hours a week:

- Be able to meet once a week with me for mentorship
- Once a week meetings with DIA for our accessibility roadmap meetings.

##What will you get out of it?

- Learn a lot about accessibility and inclusive design, which is a highly in-demand specialty.
- Mentorship by me (and a reference for future jobs!)
- Case study work for your portfolio

If you are interested, DM me and we can talk more about it. I'm looking to onboard ASAP.
